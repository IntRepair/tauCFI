Here are some comments. I don't work on CFI (my colleague Mathias Payer did some
work and I can connect you with him if you think it's useful).

My main comment about the intro and abstract 


"Limitations. These source code tools offer a certain degree
of protection when code is provided, however the above mentioned
binary tools offer limited or no protection due to an in first place
imprecise call target set per call site."

This paragraph needs to be precise, what are the exact limitations and why your work
addresses it.

I would remove the bolded paragraphs from intro, the writing is self-explanatory.

I would also describe the previous work in terms of approaches not tools. Your writing 
actually already does that.

good luck,
