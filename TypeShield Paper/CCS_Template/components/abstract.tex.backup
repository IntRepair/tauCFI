% Applications like firefox, chrome, mysql, postgresql or nginx are written in C/C++ 
% mostly for performance reasons or to have better control thereover, availability 
% and a vast number of third party libraries are other strong reasons. Yet using 
% these languages comes at the price of allowing code reusage attacks, as up to this
% day buffer overflows and other memory corruption exploits are haunting the various
% projects using C/C++. This is not the main focus, but only a prerequisite of the 
% attacks we are going to discuss. The language c++, which initially was built based
% on C introduced the concept of inheritance to allow for more flexible designs. 
% This modelled by storing a pointer to a table that stores the virtual functions 
% of the particular object. The relatively recently discovered COOP exploits and its
% successors leverage this pointer to change the control flow hijacking the attacked
% program. Although C does not employ the concept of virtual calls, it is still 
% attackable by modifying global code pointers as shown in the Control Flow Bending
% paper.
% 
% While there exists extensive work to protect binaries from the source level, 
% one might not have access to the the sourcecode or compilation process, 
% therefore binary based solutions must also be considered , of which there
% are near to none that can mitigate COOP exploits. In this thesis, we present
% \textsc{TypeShield} a tool implemented ontop of the principles introduced by
% TypeArmor, which reportedly can mitiagte COOP attacks to a certain extent. 
% We partially verify the results of TypeArmor and implement our own matching
% schema based on the parameter wideness of callsites and calltargets. 
% Our classification schema achieves an additional reduction of the possible
% calltargets per callsite of up to 20\% with an overall reduction of about 
% 9\% when comparing to parameter count based aproaches.



%Paper abstract
High security, high performance and high availability 
applications are usually implemented in C/C++ for modularity, 
performance and compatibility to name just a few reasons.
Virtual functions, which facilitate late binding,
are a key ingredient in facilitating runtime polymorphism
in C++ because these allow an object to use general (its own) 
or specific fields and functions (inherited) contained in the class hierarchy.
Despite the alarmingly high number of virtual pointer (\textit{vptr}) corruption
vulnerabilities, the \textit{vptr} corruption problem has not
been thoroughly addressed by researchers, thus the high number of vulnerabilities
based on it.

% However, because of the specific implementation of late binding,
% which performs no verification in order to check where an indirect call site 
% (virtual object dispatch through virtual pointers (\textit{vptrs})) is allowed to
% call inside the class hierarchy, this opens a large attack surface which
% was successfully exploited by the COOP attack.
% Since manipulation (changing or inserting new \textit{vptrs}) violates the 
% programmer initial pointer semantics and allows an attacker to
% redirect the control flow of the program as he desires, \textit{vptrs} corruption
% has serious security consequences similar to those of other 
% data-only corruption vulnerabilities.
% Despite the alarmingly high number of \textit{vptr} corruption
% vulnerabilities, the \textit{vptr} corruption problem has not
% been sufficiently addressed by the researchers.

In this paper, we present \textsc{TypeShield}, a binary runtime \textit{vptr} protection tool which is
based on program executables instrumentation at load time.
\textsc{TypeShield} uses a novel runtime type and function parameter counter technique
in order to overcome the limitations of current approaches and efficiently verify dynamic 
dispatches during runtime. In particular, \textsc{TypeShield} can be automatically and easily used
in conjunction with legacy applications or where source code is missing to harden such binaries.
It achieves higher caller/caller matching (\textit{i.e.,} precision) with reasonable runtime overhead than 
the state-of-the-art tool. We have applied \textsc{TypeShield} to
web servers, FTP servers and SPEC CPU2006 benchmark and were able to efficiently
and with low performance overhead protect these applications from forward indirect edge
\textit{vptr} based corruptions.
Our evaluation proves that our target reduction technique achieves an additional
reduction of the possible calltargets per callsite of up to 20\% with an overall 
reduction of about 9\% when comparing with other state-of-the-art parameter only
count based solutions.
