Many applications such as the Chrome and Firefox
browsers are largely implemented in C++ for its perfor-
mance and modularity. Type casting, which converts one
type of an object to another, plays an essential role in en-
abling polymorphism in C++ because it allows a program
to utilize certain general or specific implementations in
the class hierarchies. However, if not correctly used, it
may return unsafe and incorrectly casted values, leading
to so-called bad-casting or type-confusion vulnerabili-
ties. Since a bad-casted pointer violates a programmer’s
intended pointer semantics and enables an attacker to
corrupt memory, bad-casting has critical security implica-
tions similar to those of other memory corruption vulner-
abilities. Despite the increasing number of bad-casting
vulnerabilities, the bad-casting detection problem has not
been addressed by the security community.

In this paper, we present C A V ER , a runtime bad-casting
detection tool. It performs program instrumentation
at compile time and uses a new runtime type tracing
mechanism—the type hierarchy table—to overcome the
limitation of existing approaches and efficiently verify
type casting dynamically. In particular, C A V ER can be
easily and automatically adopted to target applications,
achieves broader detection coverage, and incurs reason-
able runtime overhead. We have applied C A V ER to large-
scale software including Chrome and Firefox browsers,
and discovered 11 previously unknown security vulnera-
bilities: nine in GNU libstdc++ and two in Firefox, all
of which have been confirmed and subsequently fixed by
vendors. Our evaluation showed that C A V ER imposes up
to 7.6\% and 64.6\% overhead for performance-intensive
benchmarks on the Chromium and Firefox browsers, re-
spectively.
