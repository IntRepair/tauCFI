This thesis is the result of an arduous journey along many paths, which weren't always as useful as they appeared to be. It would not have been possible without the many people to whom I am very grateful for providing me their support. First and foremost, I would like to thank my supervisor, Prof. Dr. Claudia Eckert, for providing me the opportunity to write and complete this thesis. I would also like to thank my advisor Paul Muntean, for helping me throughout this thesis.  Furthermore I would like to thank you, who is reading this thesis, for showing interest in security research that might help in providing better security solutions for tomorrow. At last, I would like to thank my family for their unconditional support and encouragement.
