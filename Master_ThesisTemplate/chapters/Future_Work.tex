This chapter presents in section~\ref{Future Work} the future steps in order to improve the
precision and efficiency of \textit{TypeShild}.

\section{Future Work} 
\label{Future Work} 

In future we want to address the following points in order to increase the precision, efficiency
and coverage of \textit{TypeShild}.

\textbf{Type inference.} The type inference precision of function parameters in \textit{TypeShild} can be 
increased by blaaa....
