Suggested reading order:

   If you are just getting started with SPEC CPU2006, here is a suggested
   reading order:

    1. Start with readme1st.html to get an overview of the suite and the
       process.

    2. Use system-requirements.html to help you choose which computer to use
       as your first test system.

    3. Once you've chosen the test system, install the suite, using
       install-guide-unix.html or install-guide-windows.html.

    4. Read at least the first part of runspec.html, because runspec is the
       primary tool in the suite. It is used to build the benchmarks, run
       them, and report on their results. You should read at least section 1
       through section 3.1 of that document.

    5. After that, you can pick and choose which documents to read based on
       where your needs may take you. The list in the next section can help
       you decide. Note that the run rules will need to be studied carefully
       if you plan to quote results in public.

List of documents

   The following documents are included on the SPEC CPU2006 DVD.

   changes-in-v1.1.html

   A summary of the changes that have been made in the V1.1 maintenance
   release for SPEC CPU2006

   changes-in-v1.2.html

   A summary of the changes that have been made in the V1.2 maintenance
   release for SPEC CPU2006

   config.html

   SPEC CPU2006 provides benchmarks in source code form, which are compiled
   under control of SPEC's toolset. A config file controls how they are
   compiled, and also controls various settings for your tests. If you are
   new to the suite, you will probably start with an existing config file,
   such as one downloaded from www.spec.org/cpu2006. Eventually, you will
   either want to understand the details of what is inside that config file,
   or you will want to write your own. This document tells you how.

   (History: SPEC CPU2006 V1.0 added a preprocessor, section specifiers that
   apply to multiple benchmarks or which inherit from other benchmarks, a
   host of other convenience features, and a tutorial chapter on using
   feedback directed optimization. For SPEC CPU2006 V1.1 and later changes,
   see the change documents just above.)

   credits.html

   Information about the contributors to SPEC CPU2006.

   errata.html

   Known problems and errata information.

   faq.html

   Frequently asked technical questions

   flag-description.html

   When the benchmarks are compiled, compilation flags (such as -O5 or
   -unroll) are detected and automatically reported by the tools. A flag
   description file helps the tools recognize such flags and describe them in
   reports. The tester is responsible for providing a flag description file
   to go with his or her config file. This document tells you how to write a
   flag description file.

   Note that if you are just getting started with SPEC CPU2006, you may find
   that your starter config file already points to a valid flags description,
   via the config file flagsurl field.

   (History: Automated flag reporting was added in SPEC CPU2006 V1.0, and has
   evolved in later releases, as indicated in the change documents, above.)

   install-guide-unix.html

   How to install SPEC CPU2006 on Unix, Linx, and Mac OS X systems. Includes
   an example installation and an example of running the first benchmark.

   install-guide-windows.html

   How to install SPEC CPU2006 on Microsoft Windows systems. Includes an
   example installation and an example of running the first benchmark.

   legal.html

   Copyright notice and other legal information.

   makevars.html

   Advanced users of the suite who want to understand exactly how the
   benchmarks are built can use this file to help decipher the process.

   monitors.html

   Information about monitoring hooks.

   readme1st.html

   Written in the form of questions and answers, this document provides
   useful background information to the SPEC CPU benchmarks, explains which
   system components are measured, gives a high-level overview of the
   benchmarking steps, summarizes the contents of the SPEC CPU2006 package,
   and details types of metrics available with the suite.

   runrules.html

   The SPEC CPU2006 Run and reporting rules. These must be followed for
   generating publicly disclosed results. If you plan to quote results in
   public, you will need to study these rules carefully.

   SPEC CPU2006 V1.2 has updated the rules. The most recent version may be
   found on SPEC's website at www.spec.org/cpu2006/Docs/runrules.html. An
   "Edit History" section is available at the top of the document. Please
   notice:

   Testers are required to comply with the version posted as of the date of
   their testing. In the event of substantive changes, a notice will be
   posted at SPEC's top-level page, http://www.spec.org, to define a
   transition period during which compliance with the new rules is phased in.

   runspec.html

   Information on the "runspec" command, which is the primary user interface
   for running SPEC CPU2006 benchmarks and reporting results.

   (History: features added with SPEC CPU2006 V1.0 included new methods for
   sharing an installation among multiple users; optional version checking
   against www.spec.org; CSV output for spreadsheets; emailing of reports;
   the ability to specify min and max for the graphs; and a feature to
   preview what a report will look like prior to running the test. Additional
   features and changes since SPEC CPU2006 V1.0 are described in the change
   documents, above.)

   runspec-avoidance.html

   Some users prefer to avoid using the SPEC-supplied toolset, because they
   have specialized tasks that require more direct access to the benchmarks.
   Such tasks might include instrumenting the code, doing performance traces,
   or debugging an experimental compiler. This document describes how you can
   use SPEC's tools for the minimal purpose of just generating work
   directories, for use as a private sandbox.

   (History: This document was retitled for SPEC CPU2006 V1.0 (it used to be
   called "execution_without_SPEC_tools") and it uses new techniques, notably
   --fake)

   sysinfo

   A SPEC result includes a system description. If your system allows it, you
   may be able to automate part of the process of gathering a system
   description. This perl script provides an example of how that might be
   done. Note: some web browsers may refuse to open a file of type ".pl". If
   clicking on the link doesn't work, try saving the file and opening it with
   your favorite text editor.

   (History: Automated system descriptions were added in SPEC CPU2006 V1.0
   and substantially revised in V1.2, as described in the V1.2 change
   document above.)

   system-requirements.html

   A list of the hardware and software needed in order to run the SPEC
   CPU2006 suite.

   (History: The system requirements for SPEC CPU2006 vary by release.)

   techsupport.html

   Information on SPEC technical support.

   tools-build.html

   How to build (or re-build) the tools such as runspec

   utility.html

   How to use various utilities, such as specinvoke, specdiff, and specmake.

   (History: Several utilities were added for SPEC CPU2006 V1.0, including
   the ability to extract a flags file, and to easily move around in run
   directory trees. For changes since SPEC CPU2006 V1.0, see the change
   documents above.)
