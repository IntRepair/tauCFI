  Install.01 q. Why am I getting a message such as "./install.sh: /bin/sh: bad
  interpreter: Permission denied"?

   a. If you are installing from the DVD, check to be sure that your
   operating system allows programs to be executed from the DVD. For example,
   some Linux man pages for mount suggest setting the properties for the CD
   or DVD drive in /etc/fstab to "/dev/cdrom /cd iso9660
   ro,user,noauto,unhide", which is notably missing the property "exec". Add
   exec to that list in /etc/fstab, or add it to your mount command. Notice
   that the sample Linux mount command in install-guide-unix.html does
   include exec.

   Perhaps install.sh lacks permission to run because you tried to copy all
   the files from the DVD, in order to move them to another system. If so,
   please don't do that. There's an easier way. See the next question.

  Install.02 q. The DVD drive is on system A, but I want to install on system B.
  What do I do?

   a. The installation guides have an appendix just for you, which describe
   installing from the network or installing from a tarfile. See Appendix 1
   in install-guide-unix.html or install-guide-windows.html.

  Install.03 q. Why did the installation fail with Error occurred while
  processing: C:\Documents?

   I was installing on Windows using the tar file. It said:

 C:\Documents and Settings\John\cpu2006> install
 The environment variable SPEC should point to the source of the
 SPEC distribution as an absolute path.  I will now try to set
 the variable for you...

 SPEC is set to C:\Documents and Settings\John\cpu2006

  Depending on the amount of memory in your system, and the speed of your
  destination disk, this may take more than 10 minutes.
  Please be patient.

 Package integrity check failed!
 Installation NOT completed!

   a. The problem is that the SPEC tools do NOT support spaces in path names.
   Sorry. This is a limitation of the SPEC toolset and there are currently no
   plans to change this requirement. Please use a path that does not contain
   spaces.

  Install.04 q. How do I uninstall? This script uninstall.sh doesn't seem to be
  it.

   a. You are correct that uninstall.sh does not remove the whole product; it
   only removes the SPEC tool set, and does not affect the benchmarks (which
   consume the bulk of the disk space). At this time, SPEC does not provide
   an uninstall utility for the suite as a whole. But it's easy to do: on
   Unix systems, use rm -Rf on the directory where you installed the suite,
   for example:

   rm -Rf /home/cs3000/saturos/spec/cpu2006

   On Windows systems, select the top directory in Windows Explorer and
   delete it.

   If you have been using the output_root feature, you will have to track
   those down separately. See the suggested commands in the appendix about
   uninstalling, in the install guides.

   Note: instead of deleting the entire directory tree, some users find it
   useful to keep the config and result subdirectories, while deleting
   everything else.

                                    runspec

  runspec.01 q. When I say runspec, why does it say Can't locate strict.pm? For
  example:

 D:\cpu2006>runspec --help
 Can't locate strict.pm in @INC (@INC contains: .) at
 D:\cpu2006\bin\runspec line 62.
 BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at D:\cpu2006\bin\runspec line 62.

   a. You can't use runspec if its path is not set correctly. On Unix, Linux,
   or Mac OS X, you should source shrc or cshrc, as described in runspec.html
   section 2.4. For Windows, please edit shrc.bat and make the adjustments
   described in the comments. Then, execute that file, as described in
   runspec.html section 2.5.

  runspec.02 q. Why am I getting messages about specperl: bad interpreter? For
  example:

 bash: /cpu2006newdir/bin/runspec: /cpu2006/bin/specperl: bad interpreter: No such file or directory

   a. Did you move the directory where runspec was installed? If so, you can
   probably put everything to rights, just by going to the new top of the
   directory tree and typing "bin/relocate".

   For example, the following unwise sequence of events is repaired after
   completion of the final line.

 Top of SPEC benchmark tree is '/cpu2006'
 Everything looks okay.  cd to /cpu2006,
 source the shrc file and have at it!
 $ cd /cpu2006
 $ . ./shrc
 $ cd ..
 $ mv cpu2006 cpu2006newdir
 $ runspec -h | head
 bash: runspec: command not found
 $ cd cpu2006newdir/
 $ . ./shrc
 $ runspec --help | head
 bash: /cpu2006newdir/bin/runspec: /cpu2006/bin/specperl: bad interpreter: No such file or directory
 $ bin/relocate

  runspec.03 q. Why does runspec fail with The feature
  'http://xml.org/sax/features/namespaces' is not recognized by
  XML::SAX::ExpatXS?

   a. The problem is that the ExpatXS module as built on SuSE 10.1 requires a
   type of code relocation that SELinux does not want to allow. For SPEC
   CPU2006 V1.1, several workarounds were suggested: enable relocations for
   the offending object, or turn off SELinux, or try a different toolset. For
   CPU2006 V1.2, the problem is not expected to occur.

  runspec.04 q. Why did I get the message Error: Start tag for undeclared
  element platform_settings?

   I installed SPEC CPU2006 V1.2, and now my runspec command exits
   immediately, with this message:

 ERROR: An error was encountered while parsing the flag description file
         at /cpu2006/V1.2/config/Oracle-Solaris-Studio12.2.xml
    Output from the XML validator follows:

 -----------
 Error: Start tag for undeclared element platform_settings
  in unnamed entity at line 91 char 19


   a. The problem above is that although the named file
   (/cpu2006/V1.2/config/Oracle-Solaris-Studio12.2.xml) has useful
   information about the tested platform, the information needs to be updated
   and put into new locations. For SPEC CPU2006 V1.2, instead of using a
   platform element, you need to use a platform file. The message above is
   telling you that there is no element named "platform_settings" (as of
   V1.2).

   An example of how to fix SPEC CPU2006 V1.1 flags files to match the SPEC
   CPU2006 V1.2 format is available in flag-description.html.

   You must fix this problem in order to proceed, because runspec exits
   immediately if flags files are improperfly formatted. (Or, you could do
   your run with no flags files at all, and then add them back in afterwards
   with rawformat --flagsurl. This tactic will allow your run to proceed, but
   the results wll be marked invalid until you apply the flags.)

                              Building benchmarks

  Build.01 q. I'm using Windows and I can't build any benchmarks. What does
  CreateProcess((null), ifort ...) failed mean? For example:

 Error with make 'specmake build': check file
 'D:/cpu2006/benchspec/CPU2006/410.bwaves/run/build_base_cpu2006.win32.fast.exe.0000/make.err'
   Error with make!
 *** Error building 410.bwaves
 -----
 make.err:
 process_begin: CreateProcess((null), ifort -c -Foblock_solver.obj -Ox block_solver.f, ...) failed.
 make (e=2): The system cannot find the file specified.

 specmake: *** [block_solver.obj] Error 2

   a. This CreateProcess failure occurs on Windows when specmake cannot find
   your compiler. (Recall from system-requirements.html that the benchmarks
   are supplied in source code form, and that they must be compiled.)

   The reason that it cannot find your compiler is, most likely, because:

    1. You have not edited shrc.bat to correctly reference your compiler, or
    2. You have used a config file that references a compiler that does not
       exist.

   To fix your problem, investigate and address both items.

    1. In shrc.bat, you need to either:

         1. Reference a vendor-supplied file that sets the path.

            The supplied shrc.bat in V1.2 mentions sample .bat files that are
            often provided by compilers to set your environment. If you want
            to use this option but you can't find the right file, check your
            compiler documentation, or you might try searching your hard
            drive for *vars*bat.

            The file names change frequently; check your compiler docs.

            For example, for Visual Studio 10, you might use something like
            call "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio
            10.0\Common7\Tools\vsvars32.bat" but for older compilers, you
            might need to look for vcvars32.bat, not vsvars32.bat.

            For example, when using the (mid-2011) Intel compiler, to select
            32 or 64-bit mode, you must remember to add the appropriate
            argument after the call. This statement requests 32-bit mode:
            call "C:\Program Files
            (x86)\Intel\ComposerXE-2011\bin\compilervars.bat" ia32

            For example, when using the PGI 11.7 compiler, the path varies
            depending on whether you are using 32 or 64-bit mode:
            call "c:\Program Files\PGI\win64\11.7\pgi_env.bat"
            or
            call "c:\Program Files (x86)\PGI\win32\11.7\pgi_env.bat"

            Summary: your call statement will vary, by compiler, by version,
            and sometimes, by features. Check your compiler's documentation,
            to find the right call.

         2. Or, edit the path yourself.

            You can set the path yourself if you like, with commands such as:

 set PATH=%PATH%;"c:\program files\path\to\my\compiler\bin"

            If you want to use option b, but you can't figure out what path
            to set, try looking in the documentation for your compiler under
            topics such as "setting the path", or "command line", or
            "environment variables". The documentation should mention whether
            any other environment variables (such as LIB or INCLUDE) are
            required, in addition to PATH.

    2. You must also use a config file that is appropriate for your compiler.
       Microsoft C++ users: please see below.

  Build.02 q. The file make.clean.err is mentioned, but it does not exist. Why
  not?

   The tools print a message such as:

    Building 401.bzip2 ref base cpu2006.win32.fast.exe default:
 (build_base_cpu2006.win32.fast.exe.0000)
 Error with make.clean 'specmake clean': check file
 'D:/cpu2006/benchspec/CPU2006/401.bzip2/run/build_base_cpu2006fast.exe.0000/make.clean.err'
 *** Error building 401.bzip2
 If you wish to ignore this error, please use '-I' or ignore errors.

   But on investigation, the file make.clean.err does not exist. Why not?

   a. A missing .err file has been reported on Microsoft Windows if a path
   from shrc.bat uses quoted strings that include semicolons within the
   quotes, such as:

 set PATH="%PATH%;d:\My Compiler Path\bin"  <--- wrong
 set PATH="%PATH%;d:\mycompiler\bin"        <--- wrong

   Paths such as the above may appear to work if you enter them at the
   command line. But when the tools call CreateProcess, they cause
   mysterious-seeming failures. The correct way to do it is:

     set PATH=%PATH%;"d:\My Compiler Path\bin"
 or
     set PATH=%PATH%;d:\mycompiler\bin

   Notice that in both cases, there are no semicolons inside of quotes.

  Build.03 q. Why is it rebuilding the benchmarks?

   a. You changed something, and the tools thought that it might affect the
   generated binaries. Note that as of V1.1, unexpected rebuilds should be
   greatly reduced.

  Build.04 q. Are there config files for Visual C++?

   a. Yes, but they are incomplete. In your directory %SPEC%\config\ there
   are config files that can be used to compile all but one of the C/C++
   benchmarks:

 %SPEC%\config\Example-windows-ia32-visualstudio.cfg

   or

 %SPEC%\config\Example-windows-amd64-visualstudio.cfg

   but (as of July 2011) these will not compile 462.libquantum. Please read
   the comments carefully in the above config files, to understand their
   limitations.

   Users of Microsoft Visual C++ should also please note that the config
   files from results posted with the Intel C++ compiler are not appropriate
   for you, nor is the file %SPEC%\config\Example-windows-ia32-icl.cfg on
   your kit. The Intel compiler has additional switches that the Microsoft
   compiler does not recognize, and it spells the compiler name differently
   ("icl" vs. "cl").

                                   Setting up

  Setup.01 q. What does hash doesn't match after copy mean?

   I got this strange, difficult to reproduce message:
       hash doesn't match after copy ... in copy_file (1 try total)! Sleeping
   2 seconds...
   followed by several more tries and sleeps. Why?

   a. During benchmark setup, certain files are checked. If they don't match
   what they are expected to, you might see this message. Check:

     * Are you out of disk space?
     * Does the error go away if a different disk is used? Perhaps you have a
       bad disk, or an unreliable disk controller.

   If the condition persists, try turning up the verbosity level. Look at the
   files with other tools; do they exist? Can you see differences? Try a
   different disk and controller. And, check for the specific instance of
   this message described in the next question.

  Setup.02q. Why does it say ERROR: Copying executable failed?

   I got this strange, difficult to reproduce message:
       ERROR: Copying executable to run directory FAILED
   or
       ERROR: Copying executable from build dir to exe dir FAILED!
   along with the bit about hashes not matching from the previous question.
   Why?

   a. Perhaps you have attempted to build the same benchmark twice in two
   simultaneous jobs.

   On most operating systems, the SPEC tools don't mind concurrent jobs. They
   use your operating system's locking facilities to write the correct
   outputs to the correct files, even if you fire off many runspec commands
   at the same time.

   But there's one case of simultaneous building that is difficult for the
   tools to defend against: please don't try to build the very same
   executable from two different jobs at the same time. Notice that if you
   say something like this:

 $ tail myconfig.cfg
 445.gobmk=peak:
 basepeak=yes
 $ runspec --config myconfig --size test --tune base 445.gobmk &
 $ runspec --config myconfig --size test --tune peak 445.gobmk &

   then you are trying to build the same benchmark twice in two different
   jobs, because of the presence of basepeak=yes. Please don't try to do
   that.

                               Running benchmarks

  Run.01 q. What's this specrand thing?

   During a run, 998.specrand and 999.specrand are mentioned. Why? For
   example;

    Benchmarks selected: 400.perlbench, 401.bzip2, 403.gcc, 429.mcf, 445.gobmk,
    456.hmmer, 458.sjeng, 462.libquantum, 464.h264ref, 471.omnetpp, 473.astar,
    483.xalancbmk, 999.specrand
    .
    .
    .
      Running 473.astar test peak submitted default (1 copy)
      Running 483.xalancbmk test peak submitted default (1 copy)
      Running 999.specrand test peak submitted default (1 copy)


   a. Several of the benchmarks use a common random number generator. During
   development of CPU2006, it was often useful to have the random number
   generator as a separate pseudo-benchmark, to help with problem diagnosis.
   ("You miscompared on benchmark mumble? Hmmm. Do you also miscompare on
   specrand?")

   For the released version of the suite, SPEC decided to retain specrand, in
   case it comes in useful for later problem diagnosis. It is run with both
   the integer and floating point suites, but its time is not reported, and
   its performance does not contribute to the bottom line metrics.

   You'll find more information about specrand at
   http://www.spec.org/cpu2006/Docs/999.specrand.html.

  Run.02 q. Why does this benchmark suite take so long to run?

   a. Please understand that the suite has been designed to be useful for at
   least 5 years. Benchmarks that seem slow today probably will not seem slow
   at the end of life of the suite. You can see a bit more on this topic at
   question 17 of readme1st.html.

  Run.03 q. Why was there this cryptic message from the operating system?

   a. If you are getting cryptic, hard-to-reproduce, unpredictable error
   messages from your system, one possible reason may be that the benchmarks
   consume substantial resources, of several types. If an OS runs out of some
   resource - for example, pagefile space, or process heap space - it might
   not give you a very clear message. Instead, you might see only a very
   brief message, or a diaolog box with a hex error code in it. Please see
   the hints and suggestions in the section about resources in
   system-requirements.html.

  Run.04 Console Window Host has stopped working; specinvoke unable to start
  0xc0000142

   It was reported that under Windows7 with SP1, a user saw SPEC CPU2006
   benchmark failures and this dialog box:
   console window host has stopped working
   which, after pressing the button, was followed by:
   specinvoke 0xc0000142

   The problem was difficult to diagnose, because the problem sometimes moved
   around (showing up at different stages of the run), with slight variations
   in the symptoms (e.g. which dialog boxes appeared). Eventually, it was
   noticed that an older (pre-Windows 7) version of cygwin was present in the
   %PATH%; removing cygwin from the %PATH% removed the failures.

   Because the version of cygwin was obsolete, it would be unfair to "blame"
   it for the failures!

   Nevertheless, it may be fair to point out that providing a Unix-like
   environment on Windows poses difficult problems. Historically there have
   been various approaches, with differing (incompatible) assumptions about
   how to mask or bridge differences between Windows and Unix. The SPEC CPU
   toolset has its own approach and its own set of assumptions, and this is
   not the first report of a difficult-to-diagnose error when a Windows/Unix
   compatibility product is present on the path.

   Therefore, SPEC recommends that, in general, you should remove items from
   your path that are not needed, and, in particular, that you should remove
   Windows/Unix compatibility products from the %PATH% prior to invoking
   runspec.

   If you see odd error messages such as the above, please remove any such
   products from the PATH prior to requesting support from SPEC.

   New with CPU2006 V1.2, the utility printpath is documented, with an
   example of using it for the purpose of studying the path and then removing
   cygwin.

   Why did it say that? What's the problem?

   a. We don't know. Many things can cause a benchmark to miscompare, so we
   really can't tell you exactly what's wrong based only on the fact that a
   miscompare occurred.

   But don't panic.

   Please notice, if you read the message carefully, that there's a
   suggestion of a very specific file to look in. It may be a little hard to
   read if you have a narrow terminal window, as in the example above, but if
   you look carefully you'll see that it says:

 *** Miscompare of rand.234923.out, see
 /spec/cpu2006/benchspec/CPU2006/999.specrand/run/run_base_ref_oct09a.0000/rand.234923.out.mis

   Now's the time to look inside that file. Simply doing so may provide a
   clue as to the nature of your problem.

   On Unix systems, change your current directory to the run directory using
   the path mentioned in the message, for example:

 cd /spec/cpu2006/benchspec/CPU2006/999.specrand/run/run_base_ref_oct09a.0000/

   On Microsoft Windows systems, remember to turn the slashes backwards in
   your cd command.

   Then, have a look at the file that was mentioned, using your favorite text
   editor. If the file does not exist, then check your paths, and check to
   see whether you have run out of disk space.

  Miscompare.02 The benchmark ran, but it took less than 1 second and there was
  a miscompare. Help!

   a. If the benchmark took less than 1 second to execute, it didn't execute
   properly. There should be one or more .err files in the run directory
   which will contain some clues about why the benchmark failed to run.
   Common causes include libraries that were used for compilation but not
   available during the run, executables that crash with access violations or
   other exceptions, and permissions problems. See also the suggestions in
   the next question.

  Miscompare.03 I looked in the .mis file and it said something like:

    'rand.234923.out' short

   What does "short" mean?

   a. If a line like the above is the only line in the .mis file, it means
   that the benchmark failed to produce any output. In this case, the
   corresponding error file (look for files with .err extensions in the run
   directory) may have a clue. In this case, it was Segmentation Fault - core
   dumped. For problems like this, the first things to examine are the
   portability flags used to build the benchmark.

   Have a look at the sample config files in $SPEC/config or, on Windows,
   %SPEC%\config. If you constructed your own config file based on one of
   those, maybe you picked a starting point that was not really appropriate
   (e.g. you picked a 32-bit config file but are using 64-bit compilation
   options). Have a look at other samples in that directory. Check at
   www.spec.org/cpu2006 to see if there have been any result submissions
   using the platform that you are trying to test. If so, compare your
   portability flags to the ones in the the config files for those results.

   If the portability flags are okay, your compiler may be generating bad
   code.

  Miscompare.04 My compiler is generating bad code! Help!

   a. Try reducing the optimization that the compiler is doing. Instructions
   for doing this will vary from compiler to compiler, so it's best to ask
   your compiler vendor for advice if you can't figure out how to do it for
   yourself.

  Miscompare.05 My compiler is generating bad code with low or no optimization!
  Help!

   a. If you're using a beta compiler, try dropping down to the last released
   version, or get a newer copy of the beta. If you're using a version of GCC
   that shipped with your OS, you may want to try getting a "vanilla" (no
   patches) version and building it yourself.

  Miscompare.06 I looked in the .mis file and it was just full of a bunch of
  numbers.

   a. In this case, the benchmark is probably running, but it's not
   generating answers that are within the tolerances set. See the suggestions
   for how to deal with compilers that generate bad code in the previous two
   questions. In particular, you might see if there is a way to encourage
   your compiler to be careful about optimization of floating point
   expressions.

                               Results reporting

  Results.01 q. Where did the reference times go?

   I was reading an HTML (or PDF or PS) report and see that in the table SPEC
   now prints all three observations as both seconds and ratio, with the bold
   underlined item for the median. Although this is useful, CPU2000 results
   reports included the reference times in their own column, and I miss them.
   Yes, I understand that the ratio is defined as reference time / observed
   time, so I could calculate the reference times by simple multiplication.
   Nevertheless, it was nice having them handy in the previous report format.

   a. They are still fairly easy to locate. The text format still prints them
   on every line (just like CPU2000), so if you go up to the top of your
   browser and change the .pdf (or .whichever) to .txt, you'll find the
   reference times.

  Results.02 q. It's hard to cut/paste into my spreadsheet

   a. Please don't do that. With CPU2006, there's a handy .csv format file
   right next to the other result formats on the index page. Or, you can go
   up to the top of your browser and change the .pdf (or .whichever) to .csv

  Results.03 q. What is a "flags file"? What does the message Unknown Flags mean
  in a report?

   a. SPEC CPU2006 provides benchmarks in source code form, which are
   compiled under control of SPEC's toolset. Compilation flags (such as -O5
   or -unroll) are detected and reported by the tools with the help of flag
   description files. Therefore, to do a complete run, you need to (1) point
   to an existing flags file (easy) or (2) modify an existing flags file
   (slightly harder) or (3) write one from scratch (definitely harder).

    1. Find an existing flags file by noticing the address of the .xml file
       at the bottom of any result published at www.spec.org/cpu2006. You can
       use the --flagsurl switch to point your own runspec command at that
       file, or you can reference it from your config file with the flagsurl
       option. For example:
          runspec --config=myconfig
       --flagsurl=http://www.spec.org/cpu2006/flags/sun-studio.xml int
    2. You can download the .xml flags file referenced at the bottom of any
       published result at www.spec.org/cpu2006. Warning: clicking on the
       .xml link may just confuse your web browser; it's probably better to
       use whatever methods your browser provides to download a file without
       viewing it - for example, control-click in Safari, right click in
       Internet Explorer. Then, look at it with a text editor.
    3. You can write your own flags file by following the instructions in
       flag-description.html.

   Notice that you do not need to re-run your tests if the only problem was
   Unknown flags. You can just use runspec --rawformat --flagsurl

  Results.04 q. What's all this about Submission Check -> FAILED littering my
  log file and my screen?

   At the end of my run, why did it print something like this?

 format: Submission Check -> FAILED.  Found the following errors:
         - The "hw_memory" field is invalid.
             It must contain leading digits, followed by a space,
             and a standard unit abbreviation.  Acceptable
             abbreviations are KB, MB, GB, and TB.
            The current value is "20480 Megabytes".

   a. A complete, reportable result has various information filled in for
   readers. These fields are listed in the table of contents for config.html.
   If you wish to submit a result to SPEC for publication at
   www.spec.org/cpu2006, these fields not only have to be filled in; they
   also have to follow certain formats. Although you are not required to
   submit your result to SPEC, for convenience the tools try to tell you as
   much as they can about how the result should be improved if you were to
   submit it. In the above example, the tools would stop complaining if the
   field hw_memory said something like "20 GB" instead of "20480 Megabytes".

   Notice that you can repair minor formatting problems such as these without
   doing a re-run of your tests. You are allowed to edit the rawfile, as
   described in utility.html.
