      <p class="commentaryend"></p>

<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

<p>This document is for those who prefer to avoid using some of the SPEC-supplied tools, typically because of a need for more
direct access to the benchmarks.  For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>Some users want to work directly with benchmark source code and compile by hand, rather than through the SPEC supplied tools.
  Perhaps an experimental compiler is under development, and it is more convenient to just issue "<tt>cc</tt>" commands in a sandbox.
  Perhaps a custom build process is needed in order to add instrumentation.</p></li>

  <li><p>Some users want to run the benchmarks directly from the command line, rather than via the SPEC supplied tools.  Perhaps this is
  part of a debugging effort, or is needed in order to collect a performance "trace".</p></li>

</ul>

<p>If the above describes you, here is a suggested path which should lead quickly to your desired state.  This document 
shows you how to use SPEC's tools for the minimal purpose of just generating work directories, for use as a private
sandbox.  <b>Note, </b> however, that you cannot do formal, "reportable" runs without using SPEC's toolset.</p>


<h2 id="env">Environments</h2>

<p>Three different environments are referenced in this document, using these labels:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>"<i>Unified</i>": The SPEC toolset, the compilers, and the run environment are all on the same system.</p></li>
<li><p>"<i>Cross compile</i>": The SPEC toolset and the compilers are on one system; the run time environment is a different
system.</p> </li>
<li><p>"<i>Triple</i>": The SPEC toolset is on one system, the compiler is on a second, and the run time environment is a
third.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="steps">Steps</h2>

<ol>
<li id="rules"> 

    <p><b>Review two rules:</b> Please read just one page from <a class="external"
    href="runrules.html#rule_4.5">runrules.html</a>, namely "<cite>4.5 Research and Academic usage of CPU2006</cite>" and
    "<cite>4.6 Required Disclosures</cite>"</p> 

    <p>These run rules sections acknowledge that the suite may be used in ways other than the formal environment that the
    tools help to enforce; but they warn that if you plan to publish your results, you should be able to state HOW your usage
    of the suite differs from the standard usage.</p>  

    <p>So even if you skip over the tools and the run rules today, you should plan a time to come back and learn them
    later.</p></li>


<li id="install"> <p><b>Install:</b> Get through a successful installation, even if it is on a different system than the one that
   you care about.  Yes, we are about to teach you how to mostly bypass the tools, but there will still be some minimal use.  So
   you need a working toolset and a valid installation.  If you have troubles with the install procedures described in <a
   class="external" href="install-guide-unix.html">install-guide-unix.html</a> or <a class="external"
   href="install-guide-windows.html">install-guide-windows.html</a>, please see <a class="external"
   href="techsupport.html">techsupport.html</a> and we'll try to help you.</p></li> 

<li id="pickone">
   <p><b>Pick a benchmark:</b> Pick a benchmark that will be your starting point.</p>

    <p>Choose one benchmark from the CPU2006 suite that you'd like to start with.  For example, you might start with
    410.bwaves (Fortran) or 470.lbm (C).  These are two of the shortest benchmarks for lines of code, and therefore
    relatively easy to understand.</p></li>

<li id="getconfig"> <p><b>Pick a config file:</b> Pick a config file for an environment that resembles your environment.  You'll
    find a variety of config files in the directory <span class="ttnobr">$SPEC/config/</span> on Unix systems, or <span
    class="ttnobr">%SPEC%\config\</span> on Windows, or at <a class="external"
    href="http://www.spec.org/cpu2006/">www.spec.org/cpu2006</a> with the submitted CPU2006 results.  Don't worry if the config
    file you pick doesn't exactly match your environment; you're just looking for a somewhat reasonable starting point.</p></li> 

<li id="makedirs"> 
    <p><b>Fake it:</b> Execute a "fake" run to set up run directories, including a build directory for source code, for the
    benchmark.</p>

    <p>For example, let's suppose that you want to work with 410.bwaves and your environment is at least partially similar to
    the environment described in the comments for <span class="ttnobr">Example-linux64-amd64-gcc43+.cfg</span>   </p>

    <p>[Other Unix-like systems should behave similarly to the example in this section.]</p>

    <p>For example, you could enter the following commands:
<!-- better now? --></p>

<pre>
  % <b>sh</b>      
      ... if you're not already in a Bourne-compatible shell
  $ <b>cd  /home/reiner/cpu2006/</b>
      ... or wherever you installed the SPEC CPU2006 tree
  $ <b>. ./shrc</b>      (that's dot-space-dot-slash-shrc)
  $ <b>cd config</b>
  $ <b>cp Example-linux64-amd64-gcc43+.cfg my_test.cfg</b>
  $ <b>runspec --fake --loose --size test --tune base --config my_test bwaves </b>
  ... (lots of stuff goes by, ending with)
  Success: 1x410.bwaves

  The log for this run is in /home/reiner/cpu2006/kit117/result/CPU2006.033.log

  runspec finished at Tue Jul  5 17:20:17 2011; 3 total seconds elapsed
</pre>

    <p>This command should report a success for the build, run and validation phases of the test case, but the actual
    commands have not been run.  It is only a report of what would be run according to the config file that you have
    supplied.  <span class="oldnews">(History: The <tt>--fake</tt> option above was added in SPEC CPU2006 V1.0.)</span></p> </li>

<li id="findlog">
    <p><b>Find the log:</b> Near the bottom of the output from the previous step, notice the location of the log file for
    this run -- in the example above, log number 033.  The log file contains a record of the commands as reported by the
    "fake" run.  You can find the commands by searching for "<tt>%%</tt>".</p></li>

<li id="findbuild">
    <p><b>Find the build dir:</b> To find the build directory that was set up in the fake run, you can search for the
    string <span class="ttnobr">build/</span> in the log:</p>
<pre>
    $ <b>cd $SPEC/result</b>
    $ <b>grep build/ CPU2006.033.log</b>
    Wrote to makefile
    '/home/reiner/cpu2006/kit117/benchspec/CPU2006/410.bwaves/build/build_base_gcc43-64bit.0000/Makefile.deps':
    Wrote to makefile
    '/home/reiner/cpu2006/kit117/benchspec/CPU2006/410.bwaves/build/build_base_gcc43-64bit.0000/Makefile.spec':
    $ 
</pre>
    
   <p>Or, you can just go directly to the benchmark <tt>build</tt> <a href="#buildmove">(*)</a> directories and look 
   for the most recent one.  For example:,</p>
<pre>
  $ <b>go bwaves</b>
  $ /home/reiner/cpu2006/kit117/benchspec/CPU2006/410.bwaves
  $ <b>cd build</b>
  $ <b>ls -gtd build*</b>
  drwxrwxr-x 2 reiner 4096 Jul  5 17:20 build_base_gcc43-64bit.0000
</pre>

    <p>In the example above, <a class="external" href="utility.html#go">go</a> is shorthand for getting us around the SPEC tree. 
    The <span class="ttnobr">ls -gtd</span> command prints the names of each build subdirectory, with the most recent first.  If
    this is your first time here, there will be only one directory listed, as in the example above.  (On Windows, the "go" command
    is not available; use <tt>cd</tt> to get to the analogous directory, which would be spelt with reversed slashes.  The top of
    the SPEC tree is "<tt>%SPEC%</tt>", not "<tt>$SPEC</tt>".  Instead of "<tt>ls -gtd</tt>", you would say something like "<span
    class="ttnobr">dir build*/o:d</span>".)  </p> 

    <p>You can work in this build directory, make source code changes, and try other build commands without affecting the
    original sources.  </p>  
    
    <p id="buildmove" style="margin-left:4em;">(*) In CPU2006 V1.0, the build directories were located underneath
    <tt>nnn.bmark/run</tt>; now they are under <tt>nnn.bmark/build</tt>.  For more information on the change, see the description
    of <a class="external" href="http://www.spec.org/cpu2006/Docs/config.html#build_in_build_dir">build_in_build_dir</a>.</p></li> 
    
    <li id="copy">
   <p><b>Copy the build dir (triple only):</b> If you are using a unified or cross-compile <a href="#env">environment</a>,
   you can skip to the next step.  But if you are using a triple environment, then you will want to package up the build
   directory with a program such as <tt>tar</tt> --  a handy copy is in the <tt>bin</tt> directory of your SPEC installation,
   as <tt>spectar</tt>.  Then, you will move the package off to whatever system has compilers.</p>
   
   <p>For example, you might say something like this:</p>
<pre>
  $ <b>spectar -cvf  -  build_base_gcc43-64bit.0000 | specxz > mybuild.tar.xz</b>
  $ <b>ftp</b>
  ftp&gt; <b>op buildsys</b>
  Connected to buildsys
  Name: <b>whoever</b>
  Password:
  ftp&gt; <b>bin</b>
  ftp&gt; <b>put mybuild.tar.xz</b>
</pre>

   <p class="snugbot">Note that the above example assumes that you have versions of <tt>xz</tt> and <tt>tar</tt> available
   on the system that has compilers, which you will use to unpack the compressed tarfile, typically with a command similar to
   this:</p>
   <p class="l1ex"><b>xz -dc mybuild.tar.xz | tar -xvf  -</b></p>   
   <p class="snugtop">If you don't have <tt>xz</tt> available, you might try <tt>bzip2</tt> or <tt>gzip</tt> on both the
   sending and receiving systems.  If you use some other compression utility, be sure that it does not corrupt the files by
   destroying line endings, re-wrapping long lines, or otherwise subtracting value.</p></li>

<li id="buildit"> 
    <p><b>Build it:</b> Generate an executable using the build directory.  If you are using a unified or cross-compile <a
    href="#env">environment</a>, then you can say commands such as these:</p>
<pre>
  $ <b>cd build_base_gcc43-64bit.0000</b>
  $ <b>specmake clean</b>
  $ <b>specmake</b>
  f90 -c -o block_solver.o ... 
</pre> 

   <p class="snugtop">You can also carry out a dry run of the build, which will display the build commands without attempting
   to run them, by adding <tt>-n</tt> to the <tt>specmake</tt> command line.  You might find it useful to capture the output of
   <span class="ttnobr">specmake -n</span> to a file, so it can easily be edited, and used as a script.</p>

   <p>If you are trying to debug a new system, you can prototype changes to <span class="ttnobr">Makefile.spec</span> or even 
   to the benchmark sources.</p>  
   
   <p>If you are using a triple <a href="#env">environment</a>, then presumably it's because you don't have <tt>specmake</tt>
   working on the system where the compiler resides.  But fear not: <tt>specmake</tt> is just GNU make under another name, so
   whatever <tt>make</tt> you have handy on the target system might work fine with the above commands.  If not, then you'll
   need to extract the build commands from the <a href="#findlog">log</a> and try them on the system that has the
   compilers, using commands such as the following:</p>

<pre>
$ <b>grep -n %% *033.log | grep make | grep build</b>
311:%% Fake commands from make (specmake -n build):
318:%% End of fake output from make (specmake -n build)
$ <b>head -318 *033.log | tail -8</b>
%% Fake commands from make (specmake -n build):
/usr/bin/gfortran -c -o block_solver.o -O2 -fno-strict-aliasing block_solver.f
/usr/bin/gfortran -c -o flow_lam.o -O2 -fno-strict-aliasing flow_lam.f
/usr/bin/gfortran -c -o flux_lam.o -O2 -fno-strict-aliasing flux_lam.f
/usr/bin/gfortran -c -o jacobian_lam.o -O2 -fno-strict-aliasing jacobian_lam.f
/usr/bin/gfortran -c -o shell_lam.o -O2 -fno-strict-aliasing shell_lam.f
/usr/bin/gfortran   -O2 -fno-strict-aliasing  -DSPEC_CPU_LP64        block_solver.o flow_lam.o flux_lam.o jacobian_lam.o
shell_lam.o                     -o bwaves
%% End of fake output from make (specmake -n build)
$ 
</pre>

   <p>The first command above uses <span class="ttnobr">grep -n</span> to find the line numbers of interest, and the second
   command prints them.</p> 

   </li>

<li id="rename"> 
   <p><b>Figure out the correct name for the binary:</b>  Once you have built an executable image, figure out its new name.
   You can either rename it now, in the build directory; or you can do so when you copy it to the run directory (next step).
   The new name will need to be of the form:</p>
   <p class="l1ex">&lt;exename&gt;_&lt;tuning&gt;.&lt;extension&gt;</p>
   <p> where:</p>

   <ul>
   <li><tt>exename</tt> is typically the same as the name of the benchmark, but not always.  The precise string can be
   found by saying 
   <br /><span class="ttnobr">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grep exename $SPEC/benchspec/CPU2006/<i>nnn.benchmark</i>/Spec/object.pm</span>
   <br />(On Windows, of course, you would spell "<tt>$SPEC</tt>" as "<tt>%SPEC%</tt>", turn the slashes around, and use 
   <tt>findstr</tt>)</li>
   <li><tt>tuning</tt> is either <tt>base</tt> or <tt>peak</tt></li>
   <li><tt>extension</tt> is the extension specified in your config file.  </li>
   </ul>

   <p class="snugbot">For example, if you are working with a base version of 410.bwaves and your config file has the line:</p> 
   <p class="l1ex">ext=gcc43-64bit</p>
   <p class="snugtop">the correct name for the executable is <span class="ttnobr">bwaves_base.gcc43-64bit</span></p> </li>

<li id="findrun"> 
    <p><b>Place the binary in the run dir:</b> Using techniques similar to those used to find the build directory, find the
    run directory established <a href="#makedirs">above</a>, and place the binary into it.  If you are using a unified or
    cross-compile <a href="#env">environment</a>, you can copy the binary directly into the run directory; if you are using a
    triple environment, then you'll have to retrieve the binary from the compilation system using whatever program (such as
    <tt>ftp</tt>) you use to communicate between systems.</p>
    
    <p>In a unified environment, the commands might look something like this:</p>

<pre>
   $ <b>go result</b>
   /home/reiner/cpu2006/kit117/result
   $ <b>grep "Setting up" *033.log</b>
     Setting up 410.bwaves test base gcc43-64bit default: created (run_base_test_gcc43-64bit.0000)
   $ <b>go bwaves</b>
   /home/reiner/cpu2006/kit117/benchspec/CPU2006/410.bwaves
   $ <b>cd run/run_base_test_gcc43-64bit.0000/</b>
   $ <b>cp ../../build/build_base_gcc43-64bit.0000/bwaves ./bwaves_base.gcc43-64bit</b>
   $ 
</pre>

   <p>In the result
   directory, we search log 033 to find the correct name of the directory, go there, and copy the binary into it.</p></li>


<li id="copyrun">
   <p><b>Copy the run dir:</b> If you are using a unified <a href="#env">environment</a>, you can skip this step.  Otherwise,
   you'll need to package up the run directory and transport it to the system where you want to run the benchmark.  For
   example:</p>

<pre>
   $ <b>go bwaves run</b>
   /home/reiner/cpu2006/kit117/benchspec/CPU2006/410.bwaves/run
   $ <b>spectar cvf - run_base_test_gcc43-64bit.0000/ | specxz &gt; myrun.tar.xz</b>

   Name: <b>whoever</b>

   ftp&gt; <b>bin</b>
   ftp&gt; <b>put myrun.tar.xz</b>
</pre>
   <p>Note that the above example assumes that you have versions of <tt>xz</tt> and <tt>tar</tt> available on the run time
   system, which you will use to unpack the compressed tarfile, typically with something like this:</p>
   <p class="l1ex"><b>xz -dc myrun.tar.xz | tar -xvf  -</b></p>

   destroying line endings, re-wrapping long lines, or otherwise subtracting value.</p></li>

<li id="runit"> <p><b>Run it:</b> If you are using a unified <a href="#env">environment</a>, you are now ready to try <a
    class="external" href="utility.html#specinvoke">specinvoke</a>:</p> 
<pre>
  $ <b>specinvoke -n</b>
        ... shows the command line that executes the benchmark

  <p>If you are using a cross-compile or triple environment, then you won't be able to use <tt>specinvoke</tt>.  Instead,

<li id="savework"> <p><b>Save your work:</b> Important: if you are at all interested in saving your work, move the <span

<li id="moredirs"> 
   <p><b>Repeat:</b> Admittedly, the large number of steps that it took to get here may seem like a lot of trouble.  But

    <p>But if you're finding it tedious... then maybe this is an opportunity to sell you on the notion of using <a

<h2 id="validation">Validation</h2>

<p>Note that this document has only discussed getting the benchmarks built and running.  Presumably at some point you'd like to
