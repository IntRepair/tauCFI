<!-- ...................... Installation .......................................  -->

<h2>Installation</h2>

<h3 id="Install.01"><a name="installpermission">Install.01</a> 
<span class="question">q. Why am I getting a message such as "<span class="ttnobr">./install.sh: /bin/sh: bad interpreter:
Permission denied</span>"? </span></h3>

   <p class="answer">a. If you are installing from the DVD, check to be sure that your operating system allows programs to be
   executed from the DVD.  For example, some Linux man pages for <tt>mount</tt> suggest setting the properties for the CD or DVD
   drive in <tt>/etc/fstab</tt> to "<span class="ttnobr">/dev/cdrom  /cd  iso9660  ro,user,noauto,unhide</span>", which is notably
   missing the property "<tt>exec</tt>".  Add <tt>exec</tt> to that list in <tt>/etc/fstab</tt>, or add it to your <tt>mount</tt>
   command.  Notice that the sample Linux <tt>mount</tt> command in <a class="external"
   href="install-guide-unix.html#mount">install-guide-unix.html</a> does include <tt>exec</tt>.</p> 

   <p class="answer">Perhaps <tt>install.sh</tt> lacks permission to run because you tried to copy all the files from the
   DVD, in order to move them to another system.  If so, please don't do that.  There's an easier way.  See the next
   question.</p>


<h3 id="Install.02"><a name="nodvd">Install.02</a>
<span class="question">q.  The DVD drive is on system A, but I want to install on system B.  What do I do?</span></h3>

   <p class="answer">a. The installation guides have an appendix just for you, which describe installing from the network or
   installing from a tarfile.  See Appendix 1 in <a class="external"
   href="install-guide-unix.html#appendix1">install-guide-unix.html</a> or <a class="external"
   href="install-guide-windows.html#appendix1">install-guide-windows.html</a>.</p> 


<h3 id="Install.03">Install.03
<span class="question">q. Why did the installation fail with <tt>Error occurred while processing: C:\Documents</tt>?  
</span></h3>

<p class="question">I was installing on Windows using the tar file.  It said:</p>
<pre class="pquestion">
C:\Documents and Settings\John\cpu2006&gt; <b>install</b>
The environment variable SPEC should point to the source of the
SPEC distribution as an absolute path.  I will now try to set
the variable for you...

SPEC is set to C:\Documents and Settings\John\cpu2006
If this is NOT what you want, press control-C
Press any key to continue . . .
Installing from "C:\Documents and Settings\John\cpu2006"

Checking the integrity of your source tree...

 Depending on the amount of memory in your system, and the speed of your
 destination disk, this may take more than 10 minutes.
 Please be patient.

The system cannot find the file specified.
Error occurred while processing: C:\Documents.
The system cannot find the file specified.
Error occurred while processing: and.
The system cannot find the path specified.
C:\Documents and Settings\John\cpu2006\tools\bin\windows-i386\specmd5sum: MANIFEST.tmp: no properly formatted MD5 checksum lines found
Package integrity check failed!
Installation NOT completed!
</pre>

   <p class="answer">a. The problem is that the SPEC tools do NOT support spaces in path names.  Sorry.  This is a limitation
   of the SPEC toolset and there are currently no plans to change this requirement.  Please use a path that does not contain
   spaces.  </p>

<h3 id="Install.04"><a name="uninstall">Install.04</a>
<span class="question">q. How do I uninstall? This script <tt>uninstall.sh</tt> doesn't seem to be it.
</span></h3>


   <p class="answer">a. You are correct that <tt>uninstall.sh</tt> does not remove the whole product; it only removes the
   SPEC tool set, and does not affect the benchmarks (which consume the bulk of the disk space).  At this time, SPEC does not
   provide an uninstall utility for the suite as a whole.  But it's easy to do: on Unix systems, use <span class="ttnobr">rm
   -Rf</span> on the directory where you installed the suite, for example:</p>  

       <pre>  rm -Rf /home/cs3000/saturos/spec/cpu2006</pre>

   <p class="answer">On Windows systems, select the top directory in Windows Explorer and delete it.</p>

   <p class="answer">If you have been using the <a class="external" href="runspec.html#output_root">output_root</a> feature,
   you will have to track those down separately.  See the suggested commands in the appendix about uninstalling, in the <a
   class="external" href="install-guide-unix.html#uninstall">install guides</a>.</p> 

   <p class="answer">Note: instead of deleting the entire directory tree, some users find it useful to keep the
   <tt>config</tt> and <tt>result</tt> subdirectories, while deleting everything else.  </p>


<!-- ...................... runspec .......................................  -->

<h2>runspec</h2>

<h3 id="runspec.01"><a name="perlpath">runspec.01</a> <span class="question">q. When I say <tt>runspec</tt>, why does it say
<tt>Can't locate strict.pm</tt>?  For example:</span></h3>

<pre class="pquestion">
D:\cpu2006&gt;<b>runspec --help</b>
Can't locate strict.pm in @INC (@INC contains: .) at
D:\cpu2006\bin\runspec line 62.
BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at D:\cpu2006\bin\runspec line 62.
</pre>

   <p class="answer">a. You can't use <tt>runspec</tt> if its path is not set correctly.  On Unix, Linux, or Mac OS X, you should
   source <tt>shrc</tt> or <tt>cshrc</tt>, as described in <a class="external" href="runspec.html#section2.4">runspec.html section
   2.4</a>.  For Windows, please edit <tt>shrc.bat</tt> and make the adjustments described in the comments.  Then, execute that
   file, as described in <a class="external" href="runspec.html#section2.5">runspec.html section 2.5</a>.</p> 


<h3 id="runspec.02">runspec.02
<span class="question">q. Why am I getting messages about <tt>specperl: bad interpreter</tt>?  For example:
</span></h3>
<pre class="pquestion">
bash: /cpu2006newdir/bin/runspec: /cpu2006/bin/specperl: bad interpreter: No such file or directory
</pre>

   <p class="answer">a. Did you move the directory where <tt>runspec</tt> was installed?  If so, you can probably put
   everything to rights, just by going to the new top of the directory tree and typing "<tt>bin/relocate</tt>".
   </p>

   <p class="answer">For example, the following unwise sequence of events is repaired after completion of the final line.</p>

<pre>
Top of SPEC benchmark tree is '/cpu2006'
Everything looks okay.  cd to /cpu2006,
source the shrc file and have at it!
$ <b>cd /cpu2006</b>
$ <b>. ./shrc</b>
$ <b>cd ..</b>
$ <b>mv cpu2006 cpu2006newdir</b>
$ <b>runspec -h | head</b>
bash: runspec: command not found
$ <b>cd cpu2006newdir/</b>
$ <b>. ./shrc</b>
$ <b>runspec --help | head</b>
bash: /cpu2006newdir/bin/runspec: /cpu2006/bin/specperl: bad interpreter: No such file or directory
$ <b>bin/relocate</b>
</pre>


<h3 id="runspec.03">runspec.03
<span class="question">q. Why does <tt>runspec</tt> fail with <tt>The feature 'http://xml.org/sax/features/namespaces' is not
recognized by XML::SAX::ExpatXS</tt>?</span></h3>

<p class="answer">a.  The problem is that the ExpatXS module as built on SuSE 10.1 requires a type of code relocation that
SELinux does not want to allow.  For SPEC CPU2006 V1.1, several workarounds were suggested: enable relocations for the
offending object, or turn off SELinux, or try a different toolset.  <b>For CPU2006 V1.2, the problem is not expected to
occur.</b>
</p> 

<h3 id="runspec.04">runspec.04
<span class="question">q. Why did I get the message <tt>Error: Start tag for undeclared element platform_settings</tt>?
</span></h3>

   <p class="question">I installed SPEC CPU2006 V1.2, and now my <tt>runspec</tt> command exits immediately, with this
   message: </p>
<pre>
ERROR: An error was encountered while parsing the flag description file
        at /cpu2006/V1.2/config/Oracle-Solaris-Studio12.2.xml
   Output from the XML validator follows:

-----------
Error: Start tag for undeclared element platform_settings
 in unnamed entity at line 91 char 19
 </pre>

   <p class="answer">a. The problem above is that although the named file
   (<tt>/cpu2006/V1.2/config/Oracle-Solaris-Studio12.2.xml</tt>) has useful information about the tested platform, the
   information needs to be updated and put into new locations.  For SPEC CPU2006 V1.2, instead of using a platform <span
   class="u">element</span>, you need to use a platform <span class="u">file</span>.  The message above is telling you that
   there is no element named "platform_settings" (as of V1.2).</p>

   <p class="answer">An example of how to fix SPEC CPU2006 V1.1 flags files to match the SPEC CPU2006 V1.2 format is
   available in <a class="external" href="flag-description.html#fix-1dot2-flags">flag-description.html</a>.</p>

   <p class="answer">You must fix this problem in order to proceed, because <tt>runspec</tt> exits immediately if flags files
   are improperfly formatted.  (Or, you could do your run with no flags files at all, and then add them back in afterwards
   with <a class="external" href="runspec.html#flagsurl">rawformat --flagsurl</a>.  This tactic will allow your run to
   proceed, but the results wll be marked invalid until you apply the flags.)</p>

<h2>Building benchmarks</h2>

<h3 id="Build.01"><a name="winpath">Build.01</a> <span class="question">q. I'm using Windows and I can't build any
benchmarks.   What does <tt>CreateProcess((null), ifort ...) failed</tt> mean?  For example:</span></h3>

<pre class="pquestion">
Error with make 'specmake build': check file
'D:/cpu2006/benchspec/CPU2006/410.bwaves/run/build_base_cpu2006.win32.fast.exe.0000/make.err'
  Error with make!
*** Error building 410.bwaves
-----
make.err:
process_begin: CreateProcess((null), ifort -c -Foblock_solver.obj -Ox block_solver.f, ...) failed.
make (e=2): The system cannot find the file specified.

specmake: *** [block_solver.obj] Error 2     
</pre>

   <p class="answer">a. This <tt>CreateProcess</tt> failure occurs on Windows when <tt>specmake</tt> cannot find your compiler. 
   (Recall from <a class="external" href="system-requirements.html">system-requirements.html</a> that the benchmarks are supplied
   in source code form, and that they must be compiled.)</p> 

   <p class="answer">The reason that it cannot find your compiler is, most likely, because: </p>
   <ol> 
      <li>You have not edited <tt>shrc.bat</tt> to correctly reference your compiler, or </li>
      <li>You have used a config file that references a compiler that does not exist. </li> 
   </ol>

   <p class="answer">To fix your problem, investigate and address both items.</p>

   <ol class="answer"> <li><p>In <tt>shrc.bat</tt>, you need to either:</p>

      <ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
      <li><p>Reference a vendor-supplied file that sets the path.</p>

         <p>The supplied <tt>shrc.bat</tt> in V1.2 mentions sample <span class="ttnobr">.bat</span> files that are often
         provided by compilers to set your environment.  If you want to use this option but you can't find the right file,
         check your compiler documentation, or you might try searching your hard drive for <span
         class="ttnobr">*vars*bat</span>.</p>
         
         <p>The file names change frequently; check your compiler docs.  </p>

         <p class="example" style="margin-left:5em;">For example, for Visual Studio 10, you might use something like <span
         class="ttnobr">call "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\Common7\Tools\vsvars32.bat" </span> but for
         older compilers, you might need to look for <span class="ttnobr">v<span
         class="alarm"><b>c</b></span>vars32.bat</span>, not <span class="ttnobr">v<span
         class="alarm"><b>s</b></span>vars32.bat</span>.  </p>
         
         <p class="example" style="margin-left:5em;">For example, when using the (mid-2011) Intel compiler, to select 32 or
         64-bit mode, you must remember
         to add the appropriate argument after the call.  This statement requests 32-bit mode: <br /><span class="ttnobr">call
         "C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\ComposerXE-2011\bin\compilervars.bat" ia32</span></p>

         <p class="example" style="margin-left:5em;">For example, when using the PGI 11.7 compiler, the path varies depending
         on whether you are using 32 or 64-bit mode:<br /><span class="ttnobr">
         call "c:\Program Files\PGI\win64\11.7\pgi_env.bat"</span> <br />or 
         <br /><span class="ttnobr"> call "c:\Program Files (x86)\PGI\win32\11.7\pgi_env.bat"</span></p>

         <p><span class="u">Summary: your call statement will vary,</span>  by compiler, by version, and sometimes, by
         features.  Check your compiler's documentation, to find the right call.</p>
         </li>

      <li><p>Or, edit the path yourself.</p>

         <p class="l1">You can set the path yourself if you like, with commands such as: </p>
         <pre>set PATH=%PATH%;"c:\program files\path\to\my\compiler\bin"</pre>  
         <p class="l1">If you want to use option b, but you can't figure out what path to set, try looking in the
         documentation for your compiler under topics such as "setting the path", or "command line", or "environment
         variables".  The documentation should mention whether any other environment variables (such as LIB or INCLUDE) are
         required, in addition to PATH.</p></li>

      </ol>
   </li>


   <li><p>You must also use a config file that is appropriate for your compiler.  <span class="alarm"
   style="font-size:120%">Microsoft C++ users: </span> please see <a href="#VisualCXX">below</a>.</p></li>
   </ol>


<h3 id="Build.02"><a name="make.clean.err">Build.02</a> <span class="question">q. The file <tt>make.clean.err</tt> is mentioned, 
but it does not exist.  Why not?  </span></h3>

   <p class="questionsnugbot">The tools print a message such as:</p>
   <pre class="pquestion"  style="margin-top:.2em; margin-bottom:.2em;">   Building 401.bzip2 ref base cpu2006.win32.fast.exe default:

If you wish to ignore this error, please use '-I' or ignore errors.
</pre>
   <p class="questionsnugtop">But on investigation, the file <tt>make.clean.err</tt> does not exist.  Why
   not?</p>

   <p class="answersnugbot">a. A missing <tt>.err</tt> file has been reported on Microsoft Windows if a path from
   <tt>shrc.bat</tt> uses quoted strings that include semicolons within the quotes, such as: </p>
<pre>set PATH="%PATH%;d:\My Compiler Path\bin" <span class="alarm"> &lt;--- wrong</span>
set PATH="%PATH%;d:\mycompiler\bin"       <span class="alarm"> &lt;--- wrong</span>
</pre>
   <p class="answersnug">Paths such as the above may appear to work if you enter them at the command line.  But when the
   tools call <tt>CreateProcess</tt>, they cause mysterious-seeming failures.  The correct way to do it is:</p>
<pre>    set PATH=%PATH%;"d:\My Compiler Path\bin" 
or
    set PATH=%PATH%;d:\mycompiler\bin     
</pre>
   <p class="answer">Notice that in both cases, there are no semicolons inside of quotes.</p>


<h3 id="Build.03"><a name="rebuild">Build.03</a> <span class="question">q. Why is it rebuilding the benchmarks?
</span></h3>

<p class="answer">a. You changed something, and the tools thought that it might affect the generated binaries.  Note that as of <a
class="external" href="changes-in-v1.1.html#unexpectedrebuilds">V1.1</a>, unexpected rebuilds should be greatly reduced.</p> 


<h3 id="Build.04"><a name="VisualCXX">Build.04</a>
<span class="question">q. Are there config files for Visual C++?
</span></h3>

<p class="answer">a. Yes, but they are incomplete.  In your directory <span class="ttnobr">%SPEC%\config\</span> there are
config files that can be used to compile all but one of the C/C++ benchmarks:</p>
<pre>%SPEC%\config\Example-windows-ia32-visualstudio.cfg</pre>
<p class="answer">or</p>
<pre>%SPEC%\config\Example-windows-amd64-visualstudio.cfg</pre> 

<p class="answer">but (as of July 2011) these will not compile <span class="ttnobr">462.libquantum</span>.  <span
class="alarm">Please read the comments carefully</span> in the above config files, to understand their limitations.</p>

<p class="answer">Users of Microsoft Visual C++ should also please note that the <span class="alarm">config files from
results posted with the Intel C++ compiler are not appropriate for you</span>, nor is the file <span
class="ttnobr">%SPEC%\config\Example-windows-ia32-icl.cfg</span> on your kit.  The Intel compiler has additional switches
that the Microsoft compiler does not recognize, and it spells the compiler name differently ("<tt>icl</tt>" vs.
"<tt>cl</tt>").</p>

<h3 id="Setup.01">Setup.01 <span class="question">q. What does <tt> hash doesn't match after copy </tt> mean?</span></h3>

   <p class="question">I got this strange, difficult to reproduce message:
   <br /><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hash doesn't match after copy ... in copy_file (1 try total)!  Sleeping 2 seconds...</tt> 
   <br />followed by several more tries and sleeps. Why?</p>

   <p class="answer">a. During benchmark setup, certain files are checked.  If they don't match what they are expected to,
   you might see this message.  Check:</p>
   <ul>
   <li>Are you out of disk space?</li>
   <li>Does the error go away if a different disk is used?  Perhaps you have a bad disk, or an unreliable disk controller.
   </li>
   </ul> <p class="answer">If the condition persists, try turning up the <a class="external"
   href="config.html#verbose">verbosity</a> level.  Look at the files with other tools; do they exist?  Can you see differences? 
   Try a different disk and controller.  And, check for the specific instance of this message described in the next question.</p> 


<h3 id="Setup.02">Setup.02<span class="question">q. Why does it say <tt>ERROR: Copying executable failed?</tt></span></h3>

   <p class="question">I got this strange, difficult to reproduce message:
   <br /><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ERROR: Copying executable to run directory FAILED</tt> <br />or 
   <br /><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ERROR: Copying executable from build dir to exe dir FAILED!</tt> 
   <br />along with the bit about hashes not matching from the previous question.  Why?</p>

   <p class="answer">a. Perhaps you have attempted to build the same benchmark twice in two simultaneous jobs.  </p>
   
   <p class="answer">On most operating systems, the SPEC tools don't mind concurrent jobs.  They use your operating system's
   locking facilities to write the correct outputs to the correct files, even if you fire off many <tt>runspec</tt> commands
   at the same time.  </p>
   
   <p class="answer">But there's one case of simultaneous building that is difficult for the tools to defend against: please
   don't try to build the very same executable from two different jobs at the same time.  Notice that if you say something
   like this:</p>
<pre>
$ <b>tail myconfig.cfg</b>
445.gobmk=peak:
basepeak=yes
$ <b>runspec --config myconfig --size test --tune base 445.gobmk &amp;</b>
$ <b>runspec --config myconfig --size test --tune peak 445.gobmk &amp;</b>
</pre>
   <p class="answer">then you are trying to build the same benchmark twice in two different jobs, because of the presence of
   <tt>basepeak=yes</tt>.  Please don't try to do that.</p>

<h2>Running benchmarks</h2>

<h3 id="Run.01">Run.01
<span class="question">q. What's this <tt>specrand</tt> thing?
</span></h3>

   <p class="question">During a run, <tt>998.specrand</tt> and <tt>999.specrand</tt> are mentioned.  Why?  For example;
   </p>
   <pre class="pquestion" >
   Benchmarks selected: 400.perlbench, 401.bzip2, 403.gcc, 429.mcf, 445.gobmk, 
   456.hmmer, 458.sjeng, 462.libquantum, 464.h264ref, 471.omnetpp, 473.astar, 
   483.xalancbmk, 999.specrand
   .
   .
   .
     Running 473.astar test peak submitted default (1 copy)
     Running 483.xalancbmk test peak submitted default (1 copy)
     Running 999.specrand test peak submitted default (1 copy)
     </pre>

   <p class="answer">a. Several of the benchmarks use a common random number generator.  During development of CPU2006, it
   was often useful to have the random number generator as a separate pseudo-benchmark, to help with problem diagnosis.
   ("You miscompared on benchmark mumble?  Hmmm.  Do you also miscompare on specrand?")</p>

   <p class="answer">For the released version of the suite, SPEC decided to retain <tt>specrand</tt>, in case it comes in
   useful for later problem diagnosis.  It is run with both the integer and floating point suites, but its time is not
   reported, and its performance does not contribute to the bottom line metrics. </p>

   <p class="answer">You'll find more information about <tt>specrand</tt> at <a class="external"
   href="http://www.spec.org/cpu2006/Docs/999.specrand.html">http://www.spec.org/cpu2006/Docs/999.specrand.html</a>.</p> 


<h3 id="Run.02">Run.02
<span class="question">q. Why does this benchmark suite take so long to run?
</span></h3>

   <p class="answer">a. Please understand that the suite has been designed to be useful for at least 5 years.   Benchmarks that
   seem slow today probably will not seem slow at the end of life of the suite.  You can see a bit more on this topic at question
   17 of <a class="external" href="readme1st.html#Q17">readme1st.html</a>.</p> 


<h3 id="Run.03">Run.03 <span class="question">q. Why was there this cryptic message from the operating system?</span></h3>

   <p class="answer">a. If you are getting cryptic, hard-to-reproduce, unpredictable error messages from your system, one possible
   reason may be that the benchmarks consume substantial resources, of several types.  If an OS runs out of some resource - for
   example, pagefile space, or process heap space - it might not give you a very clear message.  Instead, you might see only a
   very brief message, or a diaolog box with a hex error code in it.  Please see the hints and suggestions in the section about
   resources in <a class="external" href="system-requirements.html#resources">system-requirements.html</a>.</p> 


<h3 id="Run.04">Run.04 <span class="question">Console Window Host has stopped working; specinvoke unable to start 0xc0000142</span></h3>

  <p class="question">It was reported that under Windows7 with SP1, a user saw SPEC CPU2006 benchmark failures 
  and this dialog box: <br />
  <img style="margin:1em 4em;" src="images/console-window-host.jpg" width="368" height="198" alt="console window host has
  stopped working" />
  <br />which, after pressing the button, was followed by:
  <br />
  <img style="margin:1em 4em;" src="images/specinvoke-nostart.jpg" width="498" height="175" alt="specinvoke 0xc0000142" />
  </p>

  <p class="answer">The problem was difficult to diagnose, because the problem sometimes moved around (showing up at
  different stages of the run), with slight variations in the symptoms (e.g. which dialog boxes appeared). Eventually, it was
  noticed that an older (pre-Windows 7) version of <tt>cygwin</tt> was present in the <tt>%PATH%</tt>; removing
  <tt>cygwin</tt> from the <tt>%PATH%</tt> removed the failures.</p>

  <p class="answer">Because the version of <tt>cygwin</tt> was obsolete, it would be unfair to "blame" it for the
  failures!</p>

  <p class="answer">Nevertheless, it may be fair to point out that providing a Unix-like environment on Windows poses
  difficult problems.  Historically there have been various approaches, with differing (incompatible) assumptions about how
  to mask or bridge differences between Windows and Unix. The SPEC CPU toolset has its own approach and its own set of
  assumptions, and this is not the first report of a difficult-to-diagnose error when a Windows/Unix compatibility product is
  present on the path.</p>   

  <p class="answer">Therefore, SPEC recommends that, in general, you should remove items from your path that are not needed,
  and, in particular, that you should remove Windows/Unix compatibility products from the <tt>%PATH%</tt> prior to invoking
  <tt>runspec</tt>.</p>
  
  <p class="answer">If you see odd error messages such as the above, please remove any such products from the PATH prior to
  requesting <a class="external" href="techsupport.html">support</a> from SPEC.</p> 

  <p class="answer"><span class="new">New with CPU2006 V1.2,</span> the utility <a class="external"
  href="utility.html#printpath">printpath</a> is documented, with an example of using it for the purpose of studying the path and
  then removing <tt>cygwin</tt>.</p>

   <p class="question">Why did it say that?  What's the problem?</p>

   <p class="answer">a. We don't know.  Many things can cause a benchmark to miscompare, so we
   really can't tell you exactly what's wrong based only on the fact that a miscompare occurred. </p> 

   <p class="answer">But don't panic. </p>

   <p class="answer">Please notice, if you read the message carefully, that there's a suggestion of a very specific file to look in.  It may be a little hard to read if you have a narrow terminal window, as in the example above, but if you look carefully you'll see that it says:</p>

<pre>
*** Miscompare of rand.234923.out, see 
/spec/cpu2006/benchspec/CPU2006/999.specrand/run/run_base_ref_oct09a.0000/rand.234923.out.mis
</pre>

<p class="answer">Now's the time to look inside that file.  Simply doing so <b>may</b> provide a clue as to the nature of your
   problem.  </p>
   <p class="answer">On Unix systems, change your current directory to the run directory using the path mentioned in the
   message, for example:</p>

<pre>cd /spec/cpu2006/benchspec/CPU2006/999.specrand/run/run_base_ref_oct09a.0000/
</pre>

   <p class="answer">On Microsoft Windows systems, remember to turn the slashes backwards in your cd command.  </p>

   <p class="answer">Then, have a look at the file that was mentioned, using your favorite text editor.  If the file does not
   exist, then <a href="#make.clean.err">check your paths</a>, and check to see whether you have run out of disk space.</p>

<h3 id="Miscompare.02">Miscompare.02 <span class="question"> The benchmark ran, but it took less than 1 second and there was
a miscompare.  Help!</span></h3>

   <p class="answer">a. If the benchmark took less than 1 second to execute, it didn't execute properly.  There should be one
   or more <tt>.err</tt> files in the run directory which will contain some clues about why the benchmark failed to run.
   Common causes include libraries that were used for compilation but not available during the run, executables that crash
   with access violations or other exceptions, and permissions problems.  See also the suggestions in the next question.</p>

<h3 id="Miscompare.03">Miscompare.03 <span class="question">  I looked in the <tt>.mis</tt> file and it said something
like:</span></h3>
<pre class="pquestion">
   'rand.234923.out' short
</pre>
   <p class="question">What does "short" mean?</p>

   <p class="answer">a. If a line like the above is the only line in the <tt>.mis</tt> file, it means that the benchmark
   failed to produce any output.  In this case, the corresponding error file (look for files with <tt>.err</tt> extensions in
   the run directory) may have a clue.  In this case, it was <tt>Segmentation Fault - core dumped</tt>.  For problems like
   this, the first things to examine are the portability flags used to build the benchmark.  </p>

   <p class="answer">Have a look at the sample config files in <span class="ttnobr">$SPEC/config</span> or, on Windows, <span
   class="ttnobr">%SPEC%\config</span>.  If you constructed your own config file based on one of those, maybe you picked a
   starting point that was not really appropriate (e.g. you picked a 32-bit config file but are using 64-bit compilation options).
    Have a look at other samples in that directory.  Check at <a class="external"
   href="http://www.spec.org/cpu2006/">www.spec.org/cpu2006</a> to see if there have been any result submissions using the
   platform that you are trying to test.  If so, compare your portability flags to the ones in the the config files for those
   results.</p> 

   <p class="answer">If the portability flags are okay, your compiler may be generating bad code.</p>

<h3 id="Miscompare.04">Miscompare.04 <span class="question"> My compiler is generating bad code!  Help!</span></h3>

   <p class="answer">a. Try reducing the optimization that the compiler is doing.  Instructions for doing this will vary from
   compiler to compiler, so it's best to ask your compiler vendor for advice if you can't figure out how to do it for
   yourself.</p>

<h3 id="Miscompare.05">Miscompare.05 <span class="question"> My compiler is generating bad code with low or no optimization!  Help!</span></h3>

   <p class="answer">a. If you're using a beta compiler, try dropping down to the last released version, or get a newer copy
   of the beta.  If you're using a version of GCC that shipped with your OS, you may want to try getting a "vanilla" (no
   patches) version and building it yourself.</p>

<h3 id="Miscompare.06">Miscompare.06 <span class="question"> I looked in the <span class="ttnobr">.mis</span> file and it was
just full of a bunch of numbers.</span></h3>

   <p class="answer">a. In this case, the benchmark is probably running, but it's not generating answers that are within the
   tolerances set.  See the suggestions for how to deal with compilers that generate bad code in the previous two questions.
   In particular, you might see if there is a way to encourage your compiler to be careful about optimization of floating
   point expressions.</p>

<h2>Results reporting </h2>

<h3 id="Results.01">Results.01 
<span class="question">q. Where did the reference times go?
</span></h3>

   <p class="question">I was reading an HTML (or PDF or PS) report and see that in the table SPEC now prints all three
   observations as both seconds and ratio, with the bold underlined item for the median.  Although this is useful, CPU2000
   results reports included the reference times in their own column, and I miss them.  Yes, I understand that the ratio
   is defined as <span class="ttnobr">reference time / observed time</span>, so I could calculate the reference times by
   simple multiplication.  Nevertheless, it was nice having them handy in the previous report format.  </p>

   <p class="answer">a. They are still fairly easy to locate.  The text format still prints them on every line (just like
   CPU2000), so if you go up to the top of your browser and change the <tt>.pdf</tt> (or <tt>.whichever</tt>) to
   <tt>.txt</tt>, you'll find the reference times.  </p>


<h3 id="Results.02">Results.02
<span class="question">q. It's hard to cut/paste into my spreadsheet
</span></h3>

   <p class="answer">a. Please don't do that.  With CPU2006, there's a handy <tt>.csv</tt> format file right next to the
   other result formats on the index page.  Or, you can go up to the top of your browser and change the <tt>.pdf</tt> (or
   <tt>.whichever</tt>) to <tt>.csv</tt> </p>


<h3 id="Results.03"><a name="flagsfile">Results.03</a>
<span class="question">q. What is a "flags file"?  What does the message <tt> Unknown Flags </tt> mean in a report?
</span></h3>

   <p class="answer">a.  SPEC CPU2006 provides benchmarks in source code form, which are compiled under control of SPEC's
   toolset. Compilation flags (such as <tt>-O5</tt> or <tt>-unroll</tt>) are detected and reported by the tools with the
   help of flag description files.  Therefore, to do a complete run, you need to (1) point to an existing flags file (easy)
   or (2) modify an existing flags file (slightly harder) or (3) write one from scratch (definitely harder).</p>

   <ol class="answer">

   <li style="margin-bottom:.8em;" class="answer"> Find an existing flags file by noticing the address of the <tt>.xml</tt> file
   at the bottom of any result published at <a class="external" href="http://www.spec.org/cpu2006/">www.spec.org/cpu2006</a>.  You
   can use the <a class="external" href="runspec.html#flagsurl">--flagsurl</a> switch to point your own <tt>runspec</tt> command
   at that file, or you can reference it from your config file with the <a class="external"
   href="config.html#flagsurl">flagsurl</a> option.  For example: <br />  
   <span class="ttnobr">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;runspec --config=myconfig --flagsurl=http://www.spec.org/cpu2006/flags/sun-studio.xml int
   </span></li>

   <li style="margin-bottom:.8em;" class="answer"> You can download the <tt>.xml</tt> flags file referenced at the bottom of any
   published result at <a class="external" href="http://www.spec.org/cpu2006/">www.spec.org/cpu2006</a>.  <span
   class="alarm">Warning:</span> clicking on the <tt>.xml</tt> link may just confuse your web browser; it's probably better to use
   whatever methods your browser provides to download a file without viewing it - for example, control-click in Safari, right
   click in Internet Explorer.  Then, look at it with a text editor.</li> 
   <li style="margin-bottom:.8em;" class="answer"> You can write your own flags file by following the instructions in <a
   class="external" href="flag-description.html">flag-description.html</a>.  </li> 
   </ol>

   <p class="answer">Notice that you do not need to re-run your tests if the only problem was <tt>Unknown flags</tt>.  You can
   just use <a class="external" href="runspec.html#flagsurl">runspec --rawformat --flagsurl</a></p> 


<h3 id="Results.04">Results.04
<span class="question">q. What's all this about <tt>Submission Check -&gt; FAILED</tt> littering my log file and my screen?
</span></h3>

   <p class="question">At the end of my run, why did it print something like this?
   </p>

<pre class="pquestion">
format: Submission Check -&gt; FAILED.  Found the following errors:
        - The "hw_memory" field is invalid.
            It must contain leading digits, followed by a space,
            and a standard unit abbreviation.  Acceptable
            abbreviations are KB, MB, GB, and TB.
           The current value is "20480 Megabytes".
</pre>

   <p class="answer">a. A complete, reportable result has various information filled in for readers.  These fields are listed in
   the table of contents for <a class="external" href="config.html#Dtoc_V">config.html</a>.  If you wish to submit a result to
   SPEC for publication at <a class="external" href="http://www.spec.org/cpu2006/">www.spec.org/cpu2006</a>, these fields not only
   have to be filled in; they also have to follow certain formats.  Although you are not required to submit your result to SPEC,
   for convenience the tools try to tell you as much as they can about how the result should be improved if you were to submit it.
    In the above example, the tools would stop complaining if the field <tt>hw_memory</tt> said something like "20 GB" instead of
   "20480 Megabytes". </p> 

   <p class="answer">Notice that you can repair minor formatting problems such as these without doing a re-run of your tests. You
   are allowed to edit the rawfile, as described in <a class="external" href="utility.html#rawformat">utility.html</a>.</p>
