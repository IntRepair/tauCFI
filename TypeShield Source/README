TODO: check if the below stuff still holds ("how to start" should still be ok) 

+Heavily reduced Functionality until I get everything ported
+       -the clang parsing implementation does currently not full work
+       -node does currently not compile
+       -for now analysis and compile should work (except for node, that one does crash when compiling...)
+
+How to start:
+       1. modify config/base_config.xml so that the dir value of typeshield has the path of the project directory
+       2. run setup_typeshield.sh (if you want a *nearly* clean setup rerun with the --force parameter
+       3. run run_typeshield.sh to run thecurrently available passes (--force allows rerun of everything too)
+
+Notes:
+       For now the used config is config/config.xml after initial setup , but when resetting the environment base_config.xml is used to overwrite
+       In <pass> the order value contains the order of passes that are run
+       in src/cxx is the c++ code
+       in scripts are all scripts (for now)
+       in src/tests are the sources of the test targets
+       the config for the test targets is in src/tests/test_config.xml
+       in tests are the results (for now)
