Regarding the verify output of our tool (referenced as verify), both functions

    def parse_verify_basic(path, name):
    def parse_verify(path, name, tag_ct, tag_cs):

provide the following output:
result = {
    ["ct_index"] = list of pairs (mangled_name, demangled_name) for functions
    ["at_index"] = list of pairs (mangled_name, demangled_name) for address taken functions 
    ["call_target"] = list of parsed function entries for all functions
    ["address_taken"] = list of parsed function entries for address taken functions
    ["call_site"] = list of parsed call_target entries

    ["double_vals"] = {
        ["ct_index"] = same as above but for non first appearances
        ["at_index"] = same as above but for non first appearances
        ["call_target"] = same as above but for non first appearances
        ["address_taken"] = same as above but for non first appearances
        ["call_site"] = !!TODO!!
    }
}
