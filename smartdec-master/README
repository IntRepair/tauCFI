SmartDec is a set of tools for decompilation. These tools are:

    * nocode — a command-line decompiler;
    * smartdec — a decompiler with graphical user interface;
    * ida-plugin — a decompiler plug-in for the IDA Pro disassembler.

For building instructions, see the file named `doc/build.txt'.
For an overview of decompiler's architecture, see `doc/developer'.

Use `make' (or directly `pdflatex main.tex' twice) to build PDF files
inside the directories.
