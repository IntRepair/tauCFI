\section{Implementation}
\label{chapter:Implementation}

We implemented \textit{TypeShield} as a module pass for the \textit{di-opt} environment based on PathArmor~\cite{veen:cfi}, 
which relies on the DynInst~\cite{bernat:dyninst} instrumentation framework (we are using version 9.2.0). 
However, converting to a standalone executable is also possible, as we do not rely on any PathArmor feature
except for the pass abstraction.

Our module pass relies on DynInst, to resolve the structure of the binaries that we analyse. The core part 
of our pass is an instruction analyzer, which relies on the DynamoRIO~\cite{dynamorio:drmemory} library 
(version 6.6.1) to decode single instructions and provide access to its information. This analyzer is then
used to implement basic analysis, especially our version of the reaching and liveness analysis, which can
be customized with relative ease, as we allow for arbitrary path merging functions, however we provide 
the three basic versions (destructive, intersection and union).

Furthermore, we had to patch the DynInst library to allow for local annotation of call-targets with arbitrary
information, leveraging its relocation schema, which relies on the BasicBlock abstraction.

Additionally, to measure the quality and performance of our tool, we wrote a pass for the Clang/LLVM framework
version 4.0.0 (trunk 283889) in the x86 target code generation portion, to generate ground truth data. This
data is then used to verify the output of our tool for several test targets, which is done in our python 
evaluation and test environment.

In total we implemented \textit{TypeShield} in 5123 lines of C++ code, our Clang/LLVM pass in 200 lines 
of C++ code and our test environment in 2674 lines of Python code (all lines of code data is given 
excluding empty lines and comments).

At this stage of development we are restricted to analysis and instrumentation of x86-64 bit elf 
binaries using the SystemV call convention, because the DynInst library does not yet support the
Windows platform. However, there is currently work being done to allow DynInst to also work with
Windows binaries. We restricted ourselves to the SystemV call convention as most C/C++ compilers
on Linux implement this ABI, however we encapsulated most ABI dependent behavior, so it should 
be possible to implement other ABIs with relative ease. Therefore, we deem it possible to implement
\textit{TypeShield} for the Windows platform in the near future, as we do not use any other 
platform-dependent API's.
