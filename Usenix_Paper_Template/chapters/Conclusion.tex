%version 1
% In this paper, we introduced \textsc{TypeShield} a tool for binary harding of forward indirect
% calls based on function parameter type and count.
% Advanced code reuse attacks such as COOP and its extensions or Control Jujutsu manifest due to a combination of facts and problems, 
% like memory corruption or predictable binary layout and the fact that the larger our binaries get, the 
% higher the chance they contain useful gadgets for an attacker. However, due to their nature, traditional 
% CFI cannot detect them, as they do not actually replace code to modify the control flow, but change pointers
% in memory, which redirects the targets of indirect callsites, which are uncertain at the time of compilation. 
% Two of the most common targets are the pointers to virtual function tables to implemented inheritance in C++ 
% and global function pointers. The control flow exhibited by the binary while functioning normal and while 
% under attack will seem the same. Address taken analysis alread helped cutting down the number of possible 
% calltargets one could inject by a considerable amount. And typearmor improved on that by implementing 
% invariants for both callsites and calltargets based on the number of parameters. We had no access to
% their sourcecode and therefore had to rely on their paper to implement an approximation for which 
% we generated comparable results regarding precision. We improved on that solution by implementing \textsc{TypeShield}, 
% which allows for a more fine-grained classification of calltargets and indirect callsites by implementing a rather 
% simplistic register wideness based type analysis. However, as simplistic as that analysis might be, we showed that 
% except for special cases (nginx), we were able to improve upon a parameter count based implementation by reducing 
% the average target count of up to 20\%.



%version 2
The family of forward indirect call based attacks which can manifest due to a series of factors such as
a memory corruption, binary layout leackage and presence of useful
gadgets in sufficiently large executables is a serious security threat.
We have developed \textsc{TypeShield}, a runtime based fine-grained CFI enforcing
tool which can precissely filter legitimate from illegitimate indirect forward
calls in binaries.
It uses a novel run-time type checking technique based on function parameter
type checking and parameter counting in order to efficiently filter-out legitimate
and illegitimate forward edges.
\textsc{TypeShield} provides a more precise analysis than existing approaches with a
comparable performance overhead.
We have implemented \textsc{TypeShield} and applied it to real software such as:
web servers, and FTP servers.
We demonstrated through extensive experiments and comparisons with related software
that \textsc{TypeShield} has higher precision and comparable performance overhead than 
the existing state-of-the-art tools. To date, we were able to provide a more precise
technique than parameter count based techniques
by reducing the average target count of up to 20\%. This results in a more precise 
analysis and a considerably reduced attack surface.
