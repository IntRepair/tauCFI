\textbf{Structural matching capability.} 
Improving the structural matching capability is in our opinion the most 
important further venue of research, as we need a reliable way to 
match a ground truth against the resulting binary. This is important 
because it is a prerequisite to the ability to generate reliable 
measurements and reduces the current uncertainty (i.e., we rely on the 
number of calltargets per callsite to match callsites and furthermore
assume that the order within ground truth and binary is the same).

\textbf{Better patching schema.} 
Devising a patching schema
that is based on Dyninst functionality, 
which allows annotation of calltargets so they can hold at least 
4-byte of arbitrary data. This is required to hold the type data that
we generate using our classification. Keeping the runtime overhead
of said patching schema low should be the second goal of this venue 
after satisfying stability.

\textbf{Expanding to return values.} 
Expanding our schema to return values
is another viable venue of further work, as we were not able to 
reliably reduce the number of problematic classification regarding 
the return values of functions to 
manageable levels. Should one attempt this, it should be noted that the
responsibilities of callsites and calltargets are reversed in this 
case: The callsite requires return value wideness, while the calltarget
needs to provide it.

\textbf{Using pointer/memory analysis.} 
Introducing pointer/memory analysis
to distinguish simple 32-bit and 64-bit values and actual addresses to even further restrict the 
possible number of calltargets per callsite. This would require more 
precise data flow analysis, as in calculating value possibilities for 
registers at each instruction.
