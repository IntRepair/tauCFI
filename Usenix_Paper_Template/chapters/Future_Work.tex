\section{Future Work}
\label{chapter:Future_Work}
We see at least five different possible ways of future venues of research, 
which range from improving the structural matching between ground 
truth and binary based data to expanding our schema alltogether 
by incorporating aliasing and tracking memory operations.\\

\textbf{Improving the structural matching capability.} is the most 
important further venue of research, as we need a reliable way to 
match a ground truth against the resulting binary. This is important, 
because it is a prerequisite to the ability to generate reliable 
measurements and reduces the current uncertainy (we rely on the 
number of calltargets per callsite to match callsites and furthermore
assume that the order within ground truth and binary is the same).\\

\textbf{Finding a better suited callsite analysis.} would present 
itself as another important possibility, as we still have a relatively 
high---up to16\%---number of underestimated callsites. 
However, this venue should only be attempted after significant 
improvements to the structural matching of callsites.\\

\textbf{Devising a patching schema.} that is based on Dyninst functionality, 
which allows annotation of calltargets so they can hold at least 
4 bytes of arbitrary data. This is required to hold the type data that
we generate using our classification. Keeping the runtime overhead
of said patching schema low should be the second goal of this venue 
after satisfying stability.\\

\textbf{Expanding our schema to return values.} is another viable venue
of further work, as we were not able to reliably reduce the number of 
problematic classification regarding the return values of functions to 
managable levels. Should one attempt this, it should be noted that the
responsibilities of callsites and calltargets are reversed in this 
case: The callsite requires return value wideness, while the calltarget
needs to provide it.\\

\textbf{Introducing pointer/memory analysis.} to distinguish simple 
32/64bit values and actual addresses to even further restrict the 
possible number of calltargets per callsite. This would require more 
precise dataflow analysis, as in calculating value possibilities for 
registers at each instruction.
