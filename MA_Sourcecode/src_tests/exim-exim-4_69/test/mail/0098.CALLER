This message was created automatically by mail delivery software.
A message that you sent has not yet been delivered to one or more of its
recipients after more than 0 minutes on the queue on the.local.host.name.

The message identifier is:     10HmaX-0005vi-00
The date of the message is:    Tue, 2 Mar 1999 09:44:33 +0000

The addresses to which the message has not yet been delivered are:

  pipe to |/non/existing/file
    generated by userx@test.ex
  defer@test.ex
    Delay reason: This address has been forced to defer.

No action is required on your part. Delivery attempts will continue for
some time, and this warning may be repeated at intervals if the message
remains undelivered. Eventually the mail delivery software will give up,
and when that happens, the message will be returned to you.
